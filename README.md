# colored.js
my simple fork of https://github.com/chalk/chalk

i saw how chalk's API works and thought "hey wow this looks really easy to implement"

and boom

## API

### colored.`<color>[.<attribute>](string)`

### colored.`<attribute>(string)`

if using both a color and attribute, the order is always `color.attribute`

no ifs or buts just deal with it
